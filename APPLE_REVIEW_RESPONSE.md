## Issue 2: Business Model Questions

**Q1: Who are the users?**  
Healthcare students, professionals, and individuals seeking health education courses and training programs.

**Q2: Where can users purchase content?**  
All iOS purchases use Apple In-App Purchase exclusively. Users tap "Purchase" and Apple handles the transaction.

**Q3: What purchased content can users access?**  
- Online courses: video lessons, progress tracking, certificates, lifetime access
- In-person events: QR code tickets, course materials, certificates
- All content syncs across platforms via user account

**Q4: What paid features don't use IAP?**  
On iOS, all paid digital content uses Apple In-App Purchase exclusively. No alternative payment methods exist in the iOS app.

**Q5: Maximum users in live services?**  
Varies by organization and event. We maintain reasonable class sizes for quality education.

**Q6: Online or in-person courses?**  
Both. Online courses are accessed remotely 24/7. In-person courses/events occur at physical venues and provide QR tickets via the app. Each listing clearly indicates delivery method.
