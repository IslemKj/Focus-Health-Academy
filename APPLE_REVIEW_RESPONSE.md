## Issue 2: Business Model Questions

**Q1: Who are the users?**  
Healthcare students, professionals, and individuals seeking health education courses and training programs.

**Q2: Where can users purchase content?**  
All iOS purchases use Apple In-App Purchase exclusively. Users tap "Purchase" and Apple handles the transaction.

**Q3: What purchased content can users access?**  
- Online courses: video lessons, progress tracking, certificates, lifetime access
- In-person events: QR code tickets, course materials, certificates

**Q4: What paid features don't use IAP?**  
all paid digital content uses Apple In-App Purchase exclusively. No alternative payment methods exist in the app.

**Q5: Maximum users in live services?**  
Varies by organization and event. We maintain reasonable class sizes for quality education.

**Q6: Online or in-person courses?**  
Both. Online courses are accessed remotely 24/7. In-person courses/events occur at physical venues and provide QR tickets via the app. Each listing clearly indicates delivery method.

Hello Apple Review Team,

Thank you for your feedback regarding the login prompt when tapping "Enroll Now."

We'd like to clarify that this is the expected and intended behavior of the app:

By Design:

Users must be logged in to enroll in courses, as enrollment creates a personal account record and enables access to purchased course content.
This is standard practice for educational platforms and e-commerce apps where user accounts are required to track purchases and course progress.
Expected User Flow:

User taps "Enroll Now" on any course
If not logged in → Alert appears: "Please login to enroll in this course"
User taps "Login" button in the alert
User logs in successfully
User navigates back to the course (via back button or navigation)
User taps "Enroll Now" again → Should proceed to enrollment/payment (no second login prompt)


We believe the app is functioning as designed for a secure educational platform. We're happy to make any necessary adjustments once we understand the specific issue encountered.

Thank you for your time and assistance.

Best regards,
Focus Health & Services













Hello Apple Review Team,

Thank you for your feedback regarding the incomplete course content. We have identified and resolved the issue.

Issue Identified:
The test course in the app did not have any lessons/content associated with it, which resulted in an empty course player after purchase.

Resolution Implemented:
We have now added course content to our introductory course "Welcome to Focus Health Academy" which includes:

Introductory video lesson on health and wellness fundamentals
Course completion system
This is a brief introductory/welcome course designed to introduce users to our  platform.

How to Test:

Launch the app
Browse to "Welcome to Focus Health Academy" course 
Tap "Enroll Now" and complete the in-app purchase
After successful purchase, tap profile, then "Course"
You will now see the video lesson that can be played
Note:
This is an introductory course to introduce the app and our project.

The app is now complete with functional course content and ready for public release.

Please let us know if you need any additional information or test credentials.

Thank you for your patience and thorough review.

Best regards,
