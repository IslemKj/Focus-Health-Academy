# Adding Your Logo

To replace the placeholder logo with the actual FHA logo:

1. Save your logo image as `logo.png` in the `frontend/assets/` folder
2. Recommended size: 220x90 pixels (or similar 2.5:1 aspect ratio)
3. The image will automatically appear in the login screen

## Other Required Assets

The app also needs these placeholder assets in the `assets/` folder:

- **icon.png** - App icon (1024x1024 px)
- **splash.png** - Splash screen (1242x2436 px recommended)
- **adaptive-icon.png** - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024 px)
- **favicon.png** - Web favicon (48x48 px)

You can generate these from your logo using tools like:
- https://www.appicon.co/
- https://expo.github.io/fyi/icon-builder

For now, the app will work with a temporary placeholder logo showing "FHA" in a circle.
